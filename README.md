## Introduction 
 
ChainTrace is a decentralized supply chain solution that leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and authenticity throughout the supply chain process. It integrates seamlessly with Sepolia testnet, providing a secure and decentralized environment for smart contract deployment. 
 
## Features 
 
- Transparent Tracking: Trace and monitor the entire supply chain process in a transparent and decentralized manner. 
- Smart Contracts: Utilize Solidity smart contracts for secure and tamper-proof transactions. 
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Next.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly frontend. 
- Styling: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and customizable UI. 
- Notifications: Implement Push Protocols for real-time notifications. 
- Blockchain Deployment: Deploy smart contracts on the Sepolia testnet using Scroll. 

We Have deployed our Smart Contract on Scroll Sepolia. The contract address of the deployed contract = 0xb5abE308839C1f669F832a5478E83E539b4fD431.
We have also integrated the push Protocal notification using Smart Contracts which work semalessly with Chain Trace.
